# Dino Game

## Introduction

Hello! This is my representation of the classic game when you don't have the internet connection. I decided to modify the game.
Here are things I decided to add (this list may get extended, because I work on this):

### Version 1.0

1. Menu
2. Screen where you can restart game
3. Sounds of 'jump' and 'game over'

What do I want to add now? 

1. I want to make score
2. I need different objects (now we have only 1 cactus). It may be different cactus, stones and so on.
3. I want to develop some classes for OOP: "Dino.js", "Screen.js" and "Cactus.js"/"Object.js" (I don't know now how to do it better).
4. I want to make a better design. Now it's pretty simple. I want to make design of background in game, ground.
5. Settings and Info buttons in main menu.

## Additional
